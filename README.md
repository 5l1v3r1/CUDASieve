# CUDASieve
A GPU accelerated C++/CUDA C implementation of the segmented sieve of Eratosthenes

Most of the testing has been done on a GTX 1080 gpu with CUDA 8.0 on the most recent version of <a href="https://www.archlinux.org"> Arch Linux</a> x86_64.  This work contains some optimizations found in Ben Buhrow's <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/bbuhrow/home/cuda-sieve-of-eratosthenes">CUDA Sieve of Eratosthenes</a> as well as an attempt at implementing Tom√°s Oliveira e Silva's <a href="http://sweet.ua.pt/tos/software/prime_sieve.html">Bucket
algorithm</a> on the GPU.
While this code is in no way as elegant as that of Kim Walisch's <a href="http://primesieve.org">primesieve</a>, the use of GPU acceleration allows a
significant speedup.  On the author's hardware, device initialization takes a constant 0.10 seconds regardless of the
workload, but generation of small ranges (i.e. < 10<sup>10</sup>) is very fast thereafter.<br>

The output for each of these ranges has been verified against that of primesieve both in count and (for the ranges covering
less than a span of 2<sup>32</sup>) in the actual primes generated.  Additionally, this code contains a way of generating a
 list of sieving primes, in order, on the device that is much faster than the bottleneck of ordering them on the host.
  Generating the list of 189 961 800 primes from 38 to 4e9 takes just 89 ms.  This is about 8.3 GB of primes/second.  Primes
  are also prepared to be printed in the same way.  For example, the kernel time for preparing an array of all the (25 818 737) primes from 2<sup>60</sup> to 2<sup>60</sup>+2<sup>30</sup> and getting this array to the host is 157 ms with the GTX 1080.<br><br>

Usability
---------

At this point, the code is barely more than a proof of principle, so I imagine that anyone who is interested in this can
modify the makefile to their needs.  The include file names have not changed between CUDA 7.5 and 8.0, so this can be built without
modifications to the source code (at least in linux) with CUDA 7.5 as well.  As far as I am aware, the only compatability
issue for older devices is the use of grids with x-dimensions larger than 65535 blocks.  However, this is only for devices
older than compute capability 3.0, and the source code here seems to work without problems on compute capability >=5.0 devices.

This implementation of Oliveira's bucket method requires a fixed 10 bytes of DRAM per prime, which equates to just over 2 GB
for sieving up to 2<sup>64</sup>.  The fact that
large primes are handled in global memory, rather than on-chip, means that increasing the number of blocks working on the
task of sieving these large primes does not increase the amount of memory used since the data set is not duplicated.

Support for printing primes has just been added, but this is only available above 2<sup>40</sup>.

The provided binaries have been compiled for compute capability >6.1 devices (i.e. Pascal).  In the next few days, I'll provide binaries that support multiple architectures and older hardware.  If the CUDASieve/cudasieve.hpp header is #included, one can make use of several public member functions of the CudaSieve class for creating host or device arrays of primes as well as counting by linking the cudasieve.a binary (with nvcc).  For example:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <cuda_runtime.h>
#include "CUDASieve/cudasieve.hpp"

int main()
{
  uint64_t bottom = pow(2,63);
  uint64_t top = pow(2,63)+pow(2,30);
  CudaSieve * sieve = new CudaSieve;
  size_t len;

  uint64_t * primes = sieve->getHostPrimes(bottom, top, len);

  for(uint32_t i = 0; i < len; i++)
    std::cout << primes[i] << std::endl;

  cudaFreeHost(primes);
  return 0;
}
```
Prints out the primes in the range 2<sup>63</sup> to 2<sup>63</sup>+2<sup>30</sup>.

Known Issues
------------

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The bottom of the sieving range must be a multiple of 2<sup>17</sup>.  This will be fixed in the near future<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) There are instances where the count is off by 1-4 on certain ranges where less than an entire sieving range is counted<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Above 2<sup>40</sup> the range must be a multiple of 2<sup>24</sup>.

State of the Project
-------------------
I am continuing verification tests on outputs of the sieve at various ranges as well as working out counting and printing ranges that include less than a full sieve segment.  Let me know if you have any requests for features, and I'll see what I can do.
